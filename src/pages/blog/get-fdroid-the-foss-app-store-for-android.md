I have been using the [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/) for past few
months and the experience with it has been great and I want to share
it with others.

## What is F-Droid?

> F-Droid is an installable catalogue of FOSS (Free and Open Source
> Software) applications for the Android platform. The client makes it
> easy to browse, install, and keep track of updates on your device.

Basically all of the application on the F-Droid repository is Free and
Open-source. Meaning it is much better than using some random apps
from Google Play Store.

## Is it better than Google Play store?

Yes, but in certain way. All of the apps at F-Droid are free and
open-source. I think it is hard to find an app with such quality in
play store for doing simple stuff. Of course you will not find any
juicy games or proprietary software in F-Droid. If you want to use
apps in Google Play store with privacy, you might be interested in
[Aurora Store](https://auroraoss.com/).

## Download and Installation

It's really easy. Go to [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/)
and click the "DOWNLOAD F-DROID" button. It will start downloading the
`.apk` file.

Go find the `.apk` file which you just downloaded and install it. You
might be prompted to give privilege to install software. If your app
does not have, give permission.

## My favourite

Here are the lists of apps which I use.

### [K-9 Mail](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.fsck.k9/)

Email client. There is nothing special, it just works.

### [Bromite](https://www.bromite.org/)

Chromium based browser with ad blocking and privacy enhancements. I
believe this app is not in the F-Droid repository so you have to add
the repository manually if you want to install.

### [Imagepipe](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/de.kaffeemitkoffein.imagepipe/)

Removes exif meta data from images. It can also handle some basic
image editing which is good enough for me.

### [KeePassDX](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.kunzisoft.keepass.libre/)

A password manager for saving username and passwords which saves
locally. It is also compatible with `.kdb` and `.kdbx` files.

### [Compass](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.bobek.compass/)

I am not sure why Android does not have compass app by default.

### [Simple Mobile Tools](https://simplemobiletools.com)

A collection of open source Android apps without ads and unnecessary
permissions. It seems you can also download it from Google Play store
but I recommend using F-Droid since it is much better.

+ [Calculator](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.simplemobiletools.calculator/)
+ [Clock](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.simplemobiletools.clock/)
+ [Gallery](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.simplemobiletools.gallery.pro/)
+ [Voice Recorder](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.simplemobiletools.voicerecorder)

### [Cuppa](https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.nathanatos.Cuppa)

Tea timer. I am too lazy to open timer app and measure 3 minutes, so this helps me a lot.

## Reminder

Almost all of the apps are made by volunteers. Send some donations to
the developer of the app if you enjoy using it.
