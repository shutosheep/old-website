So when I was writing this blog, I was very excited about it. Since this is my
first blog on my own website which I always I wanted. This is my own place on
the Internet where I can write whatever I want. I don't like getting censored or
having limited accessibility. This is one of the reason why I chose to write
here.

## What's the deal here?

I want to make this website as part of my life. I can share my life and opinion
with everyone around the world. I hate writing on garbage social media platforms
(like Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, etc...). I can have more freedom and my
words don't get mixed with noise. I also want to improve my English writing
skills.

## What can I find here?

+ My life
+ Places I visited
+ Something new I explored
+ Technology
+ Or... it can be anything

## In the end...

I will try my best to update my website. But I will be busy doing other stuff so
don't expect that it will be updated often.
