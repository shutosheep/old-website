            <h1>Hi I'm Shuto ðŸ‘‹</h1>
            <p>
                I'm a random 19 years old Japanese guy who loves computers and
                software. I am also a Gnu/Linux enthusiast and live on the
                terminal.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am currently studying in the university, busy with assignments
                and exams. In my free time I like to write some code, listen to
                music. My mother language is Japanese but I also speak English.
            </p>
